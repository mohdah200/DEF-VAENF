This repository contains a set of techniques for detecting various types of on-manifold adversarial attacks in the IIoT domain. It also includes code for generating such attack samples using an optimization search approach with a generative AI model (SAAE). Additionally, these codes have been replicated based on the descriptions in their respective papers, except for the DRL, which has been adjusted based on the original code where it was published.

Please feel free to use the code, but try to cite the following papers:
